To run the docker-compose command, please make sure that docker is installed on your machine before you download and extract the docker-compose configuration. You can then start the environment by executing the following commands in the folder that contains your docker-compose configuration:

• docker-compose build
• docker-compose up

After you started the docker-compose configuration, you can access your database at localhost:5432 using the user postgres and the password postgres. And you can access pgAdmin on localhost:80 using the username test@postgresql.org and the password postgres.
